### Conotoxins -- a short overview     

Conotoxins are disulfide-rich small peptides that are channel-targeted peptides and also target neuronal receptors.
They show prospects for being potent pharmaceuticals in treatments for many neurodegenerative diseases.
Only for about 1% of all conopeptides we have structural and functional data. Thus, a classification of conotoxins would have many important applications towards the understanding of its biological and pharmacological functions.       


### Datasets      
1. Data was downloaded from [ConoServer](http://www.conoserver.org/?page=download) (access date 11/19/19)      
2. The original dataset was also [extracted](https://github.com/pgniewko/conotoxins/blob/master/data/ASA.PJS.2019.txt) from the [paper](https://github.com/pgniewko/conotoxins/blob/master/papers/ASA.PJS.2019.pdf).
